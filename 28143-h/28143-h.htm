ring. She put down her spelling-book, and
asked, "Who can that be, mamma?" Before
mamma could give an answer, Jane the housemaid
entered, and handed her a note.</div>

<p>"Why, this is not for me: it is for you, my dear," said
Mrs. Macnish, giving the note to Lily.</p>

<p>"For me!" said Lily, while her cheeks flushed; for it
was the first note she had ever received.</p>

<p>"Please read it for me, mamma," she said; for Lily could
not read handwriting quite as well as some little girls of
her age that I could tell of.</p>

<p>"It is an invitation to a children's party at Mrs. Vane's,"
said mamma. "Miss Lucy Vane asks the pleasure of Miss
Lily's company on Thursday evening, at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oh, can I go? Can I go?" cried Lily, jumping up, and
clapping her hands.</p>

<p>"I do not quite approve of children's parties, especially
when they take place in the evening," said mamma. "But
I know who will say 'Yes,' and I suppose I shall have to do
as he says."</p>

<p>She was thinking of Lily's papa, who loved the little girl
so much, that he could not bear to say "No" to any request
she might make.</p>

<p>Well, mamma was right. Papa saw that his little girl
was bent on going to the party, and so he teased his wife
into yielding her consent.</p>

<p>So, when Thursday came, Lily was dressed up in her little
white robe, with straw-colored ribbons, and her pretty
slippers, and sent in a carriage, with Jane the housemaid,
to the party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not quite such a party as I approve of. I do not
like to see little girls and boys trying to act like grown-up
people. I like to see them act like children.</p>

<p>Lily had the good taste to get tired of it all very soon.
Little girls would come along and stare at her slippers; but
she did not feel much pride in them. Little boys would
come and bow, and ask her to dance; but she had had
enough. There was music and singing, and then ice-cream
and cake were handed round; but Lily had promised to eat
nothing, and she kept her promise.</p>

<p>At half-past eight o'clock she saw Jane beckoning to her
at the door; and very glad she was at the sight. Bidding
Miss Vane "good-night," she let Jane put on her shawl, and
lead her to the carriage. "Oh, I am so tired, so tired!"
said poor Lily.</p>

<p>Mamma received her at the door of her own house, and,
taking her in her arms, bore her up stairs to the little girl's
papa. "What! has she come back so soon?" said he,
throwing down his newspaper, and taking her on his knee.</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear papa, I am so tired, so tired!" murmured
Lily. "Oh, do sing me 'Flow gently, sweet Afton,' and let
me go to sleep on your lap."</p>

<p>But mamma said, "No, Lily. You must go to bed while
you can keep your eyes open."</p>

<p>And so Lily kissed papa, and was borne off to bed. I
think she will wait till she is older, before she will care much
to go to another "children's party."</p>

Emma said

if I could read
that big book on the table."
So she went to the table, and
tried to reach the book; but it
was too high up.</p>

<p>Now, Emma had a brother
Fred, who was older than she
was. Fred was always very
kind to Emma, and now he
said, "That is not such a book
as you would like, but if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"><small>[102]</small></a></span>
will be quiet, I will read you a
story out of my own book."</p>

<p>It was a pretty little story
that he read; and Emma stood
very still, and listened to every
word. "Now," said she, "will
you please let me have the
book, Fred; for my dolly likes
stories too, and I want to read
to her." So Fred gave her the
book, and she sat down and
read to her doll.</p></div>

<h2>THE BEAR AND HER CUBS.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Are</span> there any people besides Esquimaux in the snow-country?"
asked Harry, one day.</p>

<p>"Not many," said I. "There is a small Danish settlement
in Greenland; but, with that exception, the Esquimaux<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and the bears have the country pretty much to
themselves."</p>

<p>"Tell me about the bears," said Harry. "I saw a bear
last summer at the White mountains. He was chained to a
tree."</p>

<p>"But the bear that roams about over the snow and ice of
the Arctic regions, is much larger and more savage than the
common black bear that you saw. It is of a dingy white
color. When full grown, it sometimes measures nine feet
in length."</p>

<p>"Didn't I see one in Barnum's menagerie?"</p>

<p>"I think not, Harry; for the polar bear suffers so much
from heat, even in our coldest winters, that it will not live
long in this climate.</p>

<p>"There is one thing very interesting in the bear nature,
and that is the affection of the female for its young. This
has often been noticed. Here is a picture showing an
instance of it.</p>

<p>"A Greenland bear with two cubs, was pursued across a
field of ice by a party of armed sailors. At first she tried
to urge the young ones along by running before them,
turning around and calling them to her; but finding that
the pursuers were gaining upon them, she pushed and threw
the cubs before her, one after the other, until she effected
their escape.</p>

<p>"Each cub would place itself across her path to receive
the impulse, and when thrown forward, would run onward
until overtaken by the mother, when it would adjust itself
for another throw."</p>

<p>"Well, that shows that even a bear has some good feeling,"
said Harry, "and some common sense too. I'm glad
that the sailors did not catch them. What would those cubs
have done without their mother?"</p>

Gold-Locks is in a sad condition<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of pocket-handkerchief.</span><br />

And Teddy at his play is sniffing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His little nose all red!</span><br />
Is Tony sick? Is pussy stolen?<br />

Else why this universal crying?&mdash;<br />

With many a look of indignation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Brown Billy has been sold!"</span><br />
<br />
And why? No one can tell the reason;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet I chance to know,</span><br />
It was&mdash;ah, wicked little pony!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because he acted so.</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes the phaeton all too heavy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would grow for him to draw;</span><br />
You'd think his feeble strength must perish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under another straw.</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes as light as any feather<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He rolled its dainty wheels,</span><br />
Humming and whirring like a spindle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">After his flying heels.</span><br />
<br />
And, worse than that, he had a fashion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of rearing in the air;</span><br />
And what became of load or driver<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He did not know nor care.</span><br />
<br />
Yet, without least alarm, the children<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would laugh at him, and say,</span><br />
"Do see dear, cunning, old Brown Billy:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">How well he likes to play!"</span><br />
<br />
And bits of apple, lumps of sugar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From little hands were given,</span><br />
With fond pet names, and soft caresses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sometimes kisses even.</span><br />
<br />
Brown Billy, but for your wild frolics<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We might have had you yet;</span><br />
And then these three sweet doleful faces<br />

<h2>HOW TWO BOYS WERE MADE HAPPY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">May</span> I tell the readers of "The Nursery" how happy
two little boys were made this evening by the arrival of
a present from a kind friend? And what do you think it
was? A magazine with a green cover, on which Guy, one
of the boys, pointed out these letters, "N-U-R-S-E-R-Y."</p>

<p>Max, with his chubby hand, turned to the first page, and
found the Christmas-tree, with the baby and flag at the
top. Then mamma had to read the story, and, after it
was finished, the same little hand turned the leaf back; for
the blue eyes wanted to see baby Arthur again.</p>

<p>Then how both pairs of eyes looked at Teddy with his
new sled! and, while mamma read to them the pretty verses
of Teddy's mamma, they were still as mice.</p>

<p>And how their eyes sparkled when they saw the picture
of the wheelbarrows and cart loaded with earth! for this
was just the way they used to play in the warm pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
weather. They thought the three little boys must have
had lots of fun.</p>

<p>Then they wanted to hear about "Georgie's Pet Mouse,"
and "Bess and the Kitten." They did not wonder that
"Baby" felt cross at having his picture taken; for Max
had to sit still so long, and so many times for his, that he
knew how to pity the poor baby.</p>

<p>The "Rooster" pleased them very much; and mamma
promised to take "The Nursery" to the Kindergarten,
and draw the rooster on the board for the little children
there.</p>

<p>When we came to "Bed-time," mamma thought it would
be just the thing to read last, before putting her little
boys to bed. But they begged for one more story, and
<i>just</i> one more, till we came to "By-lo-land," and after
hearing that read, they wanted me to sing it to them.</p>

<p>Then the night-dresses were brought, and snugly in their
little bed the brown eyes and blue eyes were closed, and
my happy little boys went "over the hills to By-lo-land."</p>

<h2>THE SUMMER SHOWER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Well</span> do I remember dear old aunt Rachel, as we called
her, my first schoolmistress. She wore spectacles, and I
have heard it said that she sometimes took snuff; but, if she
did, she was careful not to do it in the presence of her
pupils.</p>

<p>She was the aunt of nobody in particular; but, had she
been aunt to all of us, she could not have taken more pains
to keep us from harm, and to lead us in the way of right.</p>

<p>One day, just as school was dismissed in the afternoon, a
severe rain-storm began. "Oh! how shall I get you all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
home," said the dear old lady, opening the door, and looking
up at the clouds.</p>

<p>First she fitted me and my little sister Eva out with her
best umbrella, and told us to make the best speed we could,
and send the umbrella back.</p>

<p>As for the boys, they ran out, rejoicing in the rain, and
well pleased at the prospect of getting wet through. The
other little girls were kept waiting till the sky should clear,
or some one should come for them.</p>

<p>My sister and I started off, side by side, under our
umbrella. It was a large cotton one, with a long, heavy
handle,&mdash;just about suited to the capacity of a giant. But,
by taking hold very high up, I managed to carry it without
any trouble, and it kept us both dry. We really enjoyed
our walk; and, the harder the rain came down, the better
we liked it.</p>

<p>No sooner had we got home than the clouds broke, and
patches of blue sky began to appear. Then Eva spied a
rainbow. So mother told us to put on dry shoes and stockings,
and take back the umbrella.</p>

<p>How glad Aunt Rachel was to see and welcome us! "I
am so glad you did not get wet," said she; "but, as for those
wild boys, they would rush out into the rain, and I could
not keep them from it."</p>

<h2>A MONKEY STORY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is one of the true stories that I tell my little boys
over and over again, as we sit before the fire, and make
ready for their journey to "Sleepy-Land."</p>

<p>"When your grandfather was a lad about twelve years
old, an uncle of his made a voyage to South America, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
brought home as a present to his nephew a fine large monkey.
Of course Master Richard was very much pleased;
and the frolicsome pet would have had a warm welcome
from the whole household, had not the uncle seen fit to
report some of Jocko's pranks on shipboard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/illus111.png" width="342" height="450" alt="Brought home a monkey" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"This put the young ladies upon their guard. But old
Bella, the cook, never seemed prepared for his capers; and
the fuss she made over them pleased Jocko so much, that
she became the object of his attacks.</p>

<p>"One day Bella went to the city, and brought home a
fine new bonnet in a large bandbox. During the evening
she showed it with great pride to the young ladies; and,
unknown to her, Jocko enjoyed the sight of the ribbons
and laces and flowers from behind the parlor sofa.</p>

<p>"Like Bella herself, he was fond of finery; and the bonnet
seemed to him a very fit garment for a monkey to wear.
So the next morning, while Bella was busy in the kitchen,
Jocko went to her closet, took out her bandbox, dressed
himself in the bonnet, and stole down the back-stairs.</p>

<p>"Bella, hearing a noise, looked around, and there he was,
his head literally lost in a sea of red and yellow ribbons.
With a shout of rage, she seized the broomstick, and hurried
after the thief. But before she could reach him, Jocko had
mounted two flights of stairs, leaped out on the porch, and
climbed up to the roof of the house.</p>

<p>"There he rested; and there he was when the whole
household, frightened by Bella's shrieks, came running up
to see what was the matter. In vain Bella scolded. In
vain Richard coaxed and threatened. Jocko would not
come down until he had finished his work; for he was busily
engaged in tearing poor Bella's bonnet into fragments.</p>

<p>"As ribbon after ribbon was destroyed, her screams grew
louder and louder; and nothing could move her from her
determination to kill the monkey, except the promise of a
gayer bonnet than the one that Jocko had stolen.</p>

<p>"But Jocko never was forgiven; and the poor fellow
would have gone supperless a great many times, had it not
been for his devoted young master."</p>

<h2>WHAT BRAVO TOLD RORY.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Tell</span> us a story, Kate," said Emma.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>do</i>," chimed in Bertha.</p>

<p>"<i>Will</i> you tell us a story?" said Herbert.</p>

<p>Thus entreated by these dear, good children, I could not
refuse. So while their three heads, close together, with their
bright faces beaming upon me and upon each other, formed
a pretty picture, I told them this story about two shepherd-dogs,
Bravo and Rory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When farmer John and his bride moved into their little white house,
a mile from the old homestead, they took with them the young dog,
Bravo, and left Rory to guard the old house. Bravo was large and
wide awake, but only five months old. He seemed very happy in his
new home. His master taught him many curious things; and for a
week or more he showed no signs of home-sickness.</p>

<p>"But when old Toss, from the tannery near by, made an attack upon
him, although Bravo's fleetness saved him from harm, he began to wish
he had never left his puppy-hood's home to live with farmer John. Down
he sat at the door of his kennel, with a lonely and forsaken look, trying
to smooth down the hair of his sleek coat that old Toss had ruffled.</p>

<p>"The tanner's dog repeated his attack for two or three days, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
more than that, drove poor Bravo from his nice warm quarters at night,
compelling him to lie out in the cold. Then Bravo said to himself,
'Something must be done. I dare not fight Toss; for he has long teeth,
and is a savage dog,&mdash;more than a match for me. I think my best plan
is to go and tell Rory.' And away he sped, just at sunrise, and came back
in time for breakfast, with a cheerful look in his face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus117.png" width="450" height="370" alt="Three children" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Now, Rory was steady and brave and wise. He had no love for
running round nights: so it surprised his master, when, just as the sun
went down that day, Rory started down the road, and up the lane to
farmer John's. On he went, with a grave look, without stopping to greet
any old friend, even by a wag of his tail. Bravo met him, and whisked
around him; and, after a short consultation, the two dogs crawled into
the kennel, Rory staying nearest to the door.</p>

<p>"The moon shone clear and bright, and all was still until about midnight,
when farmer John's wife was suddenly awakened by a sound of
growling, snarling, and yelping. 'Wake up, John, quick, quick! Get
up!' she shouted. The farmer leaped from his bed, and, half-dressed,
ran to the door, thinking that the dogs were killing sheep; but instead
of sheep, Rory and Bravo had Toss at their mercy, and were giving him
a fearful punishment."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good, good!" shouted Herbert. "That served him
just right."</p>

<p>But little Bertha turned a wondering look upon Herbert;
she could not help feeling pity even for Toss.</p>

<p>"Let us hear the rest of the story," said Emma.</p>

<p>So I went on,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The sharp voice of the farmer made Rory and Bravo release their
victim; and Toss, in a crestfallen way, started for his home; but, before
he could get over the fence, Rory gave him a final clutch that sent him
off yelping. He never came back; and when he met Bravo afterwards,
he was careful not to trouble him.</p>

<p>"In a short time Bravo grew to be so strong and brave, that he could
fight his own battles without the aid of his friend Rory."</p></div>

<p>The three children, who had listened very attentively to
the story, now talked it over; and they came to the conclusion
that Toss received a good lesson, and was probably a
better dog after it. "For," said Herbert, "a dog who
abuses a smaller dog is almost as mean as a big boy who
tyrannizes over a little boy."</p>

<h2>PLAYING THE CHINAMAN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Franz</span> is a little boy about four years old, who lives in
Brooklyn, California. His favorite play is to take some
pieces of cloth, fill his mouth with water, turn his head
from side to side, letting the water squirt from the corners
of his mouth upon them (as he has seen the Chinamen do
at the laundry), fold them, turn the iron-stand on its back,
and carefully smooth them. This is Foo Lee, washing and
ironing.</p>

<p>Sometimes the clothes are not wet enough, and the
sprinkling goes on with the ironing.</p>

<p>"Your clothes will smell of tobacco and opium, if you
sprinkle them so much," says Franz's elder brother.</p>

<p>"No, they won't," says the little wash-man. "Me do
them good; me do them cheap."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>When he gets tired of this, he puts his wash into a piece
of paper, and takes the bundle to mamma. "I hope the
clothes are not too blue, John," says mamma.</p>

<p>"No," answers Foo Lee. "They done good this time."</p>

<p>"And did you find my stockings, which were missing from
last week's wash?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they all here. I found them: they all right this
time,&mdash;fifty dozen."</p>

<p>"How much shall I pay you?"</p>

<p>"Six bits." (Seventy-five cents.) "I do them velly
cheap."</p>

<p>Mamma gives him two buttons,&mdash;one large one for the
four-bit piece, (fifty cents), and a smaller one for the two
bits (twenty-five cents).</p>

<p>"Thankee. Good-baah!" says Foo Lee. "Good-by,"
returns mamma.</p>

<h2>PANSY'S SECRET.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Pansy</span> had a secret, and nobody could find it out. She
would come down stairs in the morning, and seat herself at
the breakfast-table, and then papa would say, "Well, Pansy,
are you going to tell us your secret to-day?"</p>

<p>Pansy would shake her head, and reply, "You must guess
it, papa! Can you not guess it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you have a new tooth coming."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, that is not it. Mother can guess better than
that, I think. It concerns you, mother."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess," said mother, "that you are to have the
present of a kitten from aunt Julia."</p>

<p>"And I guess," said brother John, who was five years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
older than Pansy, "I guess you are knitting a pair of
woollen cuffs for papa."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/illus121.png" width="323" height="400" alt="Pansy on the stairs" title="" />
</div>

<p>"You are all wrong," cried Pansy, "and I shall not tell
you my secret to-day."</p>

<p>The next morning, as she was coming down stairs, she
paused, and said to herself, "Shall I tell them my secret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
now? No, Pansy, let them see that you can keep a
secret."</p>

<p>No sooner was she seated at the table in her high-chair,
than papa said, "Well, Pansy, how much longer are you
going to keep us in the dark? Are you going to tell us
your secret?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, papa," said Pansy, looking up with a roguish
smile.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" said mother, laying down her knife
and fork, and putting her hand to her head.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it is any thing of any account," cried
brother John. "She wants to keep us curious."</p>

<p>"Well, I think Pansy must be learning a new piece to
recite," said her mother.</p>

<p>"That's not it," said Pansy. "It's a 'portant secret: one
that my mother will like to hear."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's important, is it?" said papa. "I do wonder
what it can be."</p>

<p>"Mother, what day was it that you lost your wedding-ring?"
said John.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of it, John. It was more than a month
ago. I have hunted high and low, and cannot find it. I
would have given all my other jewelry rather than have
lost it."</p>

<p>Here Pansy turned red in the face, got down from her
high-chair, and ran out of the room.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?" said papa. "The little rogue has
found the ring, and that's her 'portant secret."</p>

<p>In a minute Pansy came back, holding up the ring, and
her face radiant with delight. "I found it, mother, among
my doll's things. You must have dropped it there when
you were fixing them."</p>

<p>And so little Pansy's secret was out at last!</p>

<h2>SAGACITY OF THE DEER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A friend</span> of mine who has been in the habit of hunting
deer in the Adirondack Mountains, is of opinion that the
deer is often more than a match for the dog in sagacity.
The deer seems to be well aware that the dog is guided by
his faculty of scent in tracking him; and all the deer's
efforts are directed to baffling and thwarting this keen and
wonderful sense with which the dog is gifted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>With this purpose, the deer will often make enormous
leaps, or run around in a circle so as to confuse and puzzle
his pursuers. He will mount a stone wall, and run along it
for some distance, well aware that the dog cannot scent him
so well on the rock as on the grass. If he can find a pond
or stream of water, the deer will plunge in and swim a long
distance, so that the dogs may lose his trail.</p>

<p>It is a joyful sound to the poor hunted deer when the
dogs send up that sad, dismal howl, which they give utterance
to when they have lost all scent of the deer, and
despair of finding it. He is then a happy deer. He hides
quietly in some covert among the bushes, and he will take
care to place himself where the wind will carry all odors
of his body away from the direction where he supposes the
dogs to be.</p>

<p>So you see the deer is by no means a stupid animal. He
knows, better than many a little boy, how to take care of
himself, and get out of the way of danger. And now can
you tell me in what part of the State of New York are the
Adirondack Mountains?</p>

<p>From a correspondent in Springfield, Mo., I have a letter,
in which the writer says: "I suppose the Boston boys don't
have deer for pets. I have a young one named Billy, and
he eats corn out of my pocket. When I come home from
school he always runs to meet me. Although he can jump
over fences, he never tries to run away. He wears a collar
with a bell on it: so we can hear him when he is down
in the orchard eating apples, which he seems to be very
fond of."</p>

<span class="smcap">Grandma</span> dear has gone to sleep;<br />
See how still the children keep!<br />
Little Johnny leaves his toys,<br />
And, without a bit of noise,<br />
Rests his book on grandma's lap<br />
While she takes her peaceful nap;<br />
Darling Mabel on the floor<br />
Sits all quiet and demure;<br />
And old pussy tries to be<br />
Just the stillest of the three.<br />

1. There was a grasshopper lived in a palm-tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Silver-voiced as a frog in June;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was not pleas'd with his situation,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thought he'd like to go to the moon.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! Heigh-ho! . . . How shall I get there? oh! . . .</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A hop and a skip and a flop and a flip, and over the clouds I'll go.</span><br />
<br />
2. Up he went like a streak of lightning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lit on the moon like a thunderbolt.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nought could he find but a man with a lantern,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Riding about on a pea-green colt.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! Heigh-ho! . . . Why did I come here? oh! . . .</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fling and a swing and a flap of my wing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And back to the earth I'll go.</span><br />
<br />
3. Off he shot like a blazing rocket;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down he came like a falling star.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What should he meet but a gay little goshawk,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flying up from the earth so far.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! Heigh-ho! . . . Poor little grasshopper, oh! . . .</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A snap and a squeak in the bonny bird's beak,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there was an end of him, oh!</span><br />
